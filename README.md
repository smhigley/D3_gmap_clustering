### Flickr + Google Maps + D3 mapping and clustering project

This is a work in progress intended to display clustered lat/long-tagged flickr photos on a map with a leaflet-like zooming animation.

Live demo on [codepen](http://codepen.io/smhigley/pen/jifrK)

This demo is using sample data created from a flickr API query, and sorted by distance per zoom level with a python script.
